        <p>The Brigade Project Index provides the data for this application.  It is a collaborative project involving core contributors from across many brigades. We design, develop, and maintain a set of tools and practices for mapping out all the work being done on projects across the entire global network of civic hacking organizations and Code for America brigades. Our core goal is to publish a rich and constantly-updated database of projects that any number of network projects can use as a data source to help us get better connected.</p>

        <p>This application is mostly maintained by CfA brigade network volunteers, with some support from CfA. We would welcome contributions of code, ideas, designs, and bug reports. We can't guarantee that anything will be implemented in a particularly timely way since we all have day jobs, but we are excited to collaborate with you <3</p>
